# Performance Measurement

## Using C++ chrono timers

The easiest way to measure the timing information is using C++ chrono library:

```cpp
#include <chrono>
using std::chrono::duration_cast;
using std::chrono::milliseconds;
using std::chrono::system_clock;

// ...

auto t0 = system_clock::now();
// do something
auto t1 = system_clock::now();

auto delta_t = duration_cast<milliseconds>(t1 - t0);

std::cout << "Time taken to do something: " << delta_t.count() << " ms\n";

// ...

```

It is worth to note that the C++ chrono clocks measure real time (wall-clock time). However, a more detailed analysis often requries measuring the CPU time.

> CPU time is defined as the time spent executing the program's instructions. It does not include the time spent waiting for input or output (I/O) operations to be completed. It is typically measured in clock cycles or seconds.

Ideally the CPU time and real time are the same. 

## Measuring CPU time using OS-specific functions

The CPU time can be measured using OS-specific functions. For example, on Linux, the `clock_gettime()` function can be used:

```cpp
timespec t0, t1;
clockid = CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID;
// ...

clock_gettime(clockid, &t0);
// do something
clock_gettime(clockid, &t1);
double delta_t = (t1.tv_sec - t0.tv_sec) + 1e-9 * (t1.tv_nsec - t0.tv_nsec);

// ...
```

The above code measures the CPU time of the current process. The `clockid` can be set to `CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID` to measure the CPU time of the current program.

There are other kinds of clock provided. For example:
- `CLOCK_REALTIME`: system-wide real-time clock.
- `CLOCK_THREAD_CPU_TIME_ID`: similar to `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`, but measures the CPU time of the current thread.


### Interpreting CPU Time and Real Time

There are different ways to interpret the CPU time and the real time. If CPU time is less than the real time, it can means:
- The program is waiting for I/O operations to be completed. 
- The CPU is overlorded by other processes. Therefore the CPU needs to switch between different processes.
- The CPU does nothing. For example, the program is waiting for user input.

In real life, we usually distrubute the computation load to different processors. Therefore, the CPU time can greater than the real time.

Considering the below example:

```cpp

auto future = std::async(std::launch::async, []() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
    /* do something */
  }
});

for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
  /* do something */
}

future.wait();

```

The above program does the following:
- First, it creates a thread to perform some operation.
- Then, it performs some operation in the main thread.
- Finally, it waits for the thread to finish.

Expected CPU time and real time (not the real result):
- CPU time: 100 us
- Readl time: 53 us


You can see that we use two threads (main, and the one created by `std::async`) to compute the result. As CPU time measures the total amount of time spent executing the program's instructions, the CPU time is greater than the real time. That means we use 53 us to finish the computation that requires 100 us.
